Just another map generator.
Originally programmed by James Kuch and Richard Nicholson for CMPM146 at UCSC.


Files:

Main.java
-The main GUI. Initializes the frame that the map is drawn on and the menubar.

Visualizer.java
-All the map generation is actually done here

Tile.java
-The Tile class, holds all properties of a tile and visual color representations based on those properties

Pair.java
-Literally the generic Pair class to hold 2 objects of data at once.
-Sure, we probably could've just grabbed java.util.Pair or whatever but Richard decided to code this in its entirety.
 All 8 lines of it.
